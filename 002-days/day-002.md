# SELECTORS

- To apply `CSS` to an element you need to select it.

### Example
- If you've got some text that you only want to be larger and red if it's the first paragraph of an article.
```html
<article>
  <p>I want to be red and larger than the other text.</p>
  <p>I want to be normal sized and the default color.</p>
</article>
```
```css
article p:first-of-type {
  color: red;
  font-size: 1.5em;
}
```

## The parts of a CSS rule #


![](./css-selector.svg)
In this CSS rule,
- the selector is `.my-css-rule` which finds all elements with a class of `my-css-rule` on the page.

### Three declarations

There are three declarations within the curly brackets.
- A declaration is a property and value pair which applies styles to the elements matched by the selectors.
- A CSS rule can have as many declarations and selectors as you like.

---
## `Simple selectors`
The most straightforward group of selectors target HTML elements plus classes, IDs, and other attributes which may be added to an HTML tag.

## `Universal selector`
A universal selector—also known as a wildcard—matches any element.

```
* {
  color: hotpink;
}
```
This rule causes every HTML element on the page to have hotpink text.

---


## `Type selector` #
A type selector matches a HTML element directly.

```
section {
  padding: 2em;
}
```
This rule causes every `<section>` element to have `2em` of padding on all sides.

## `Class selector`

A HTML element can have one or more items defined in their class attribute. The class selector matches any element that has that class applied to it.
```html
<div class="my-class"></div>
<button class="my-class"></button>
<p class="my-class"></p>
```
- Any element that has the class applied to it will get colored red:


```css
.my-class {
  color: red;
}
```

- A HTML element that has a class of .my-class will still be matched to the above CSS rule, even if they have several other classes, like this:

```html
<div class="my-class another-class some-other-class"></div>
```
- This is because CSS looks for a class attribute that contains the defined class, rather than matching that class exactly.

---

## `ID selector`
An HTML element with an id attribute should be the only element on a page with that ID value. You select elements with an ID selector like this:


```css
#rad {
  border: 1px solid blue;
}
```
- This CSS would apply a blue border to the HTML element that has an id of rad, like this:

```html
<div id="rad"></div>
```
---

## `Attribute selector`

- look for an element which have a certain html attribute.

- the selector with square brackets ([]) will instruct css to look for an element with given attributes.

```css
[data-type="primary"]{
    color:green;
}
```
```html
<div data-type="primary"><div>
```

- look for elements with attributes presents, regardless of its values.

```css
[data-type]{
    color:green;
}
```
- Both of these `<div>` elements will have red text.

```html
<div data-type="primary"><div>
<div data-type="secondary"><div>
```
---
## case-sensitive 
- adding an `s` operator to your attribute selector.
```css
[data-type="primary",s]{
    color:red;
}
```
```html
<div data-type="primary"><div>
<div data-type="Primary"><div>
```
- the htmle element with data-type attribute's values `Primary` instead of `primary` will not get its text color red.

- You can do the opposite—case insensitivity—by using an i operator.
```css
[data-type="primary",i]{
    color:red;
}
```

Along with case operators, you have access to operators that match portions of strings inside attribute values.


## Contain a portion of attribute

- A href that contains "example.com"
```css
[href*='example.com'] {
  color: red;
}
```

## Attributes value that start with
- A href that starts with https 
```css
[href^='https'] {
  color: green;
}
```

## Attributes value that end with
- A href that ends with .com 
```css
[href$='.com'] {
  color: blue;
}
```
